## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that enables AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and others to interact directly with external services. With Affonso's MCP integration, you can manage your affiliate program using natural language commands.

<Info>
MCP allows AI assistants to read and modify your affiliate data in real-time, making it perfect for quick queries, bulk operations, and automation workflows.

## How It Works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant AI Assistant
    participant Affonso MCP
    participant Database

    User->>AI Assistant: "Show my pending affiliates"
    AI Assistant->>Affonso MCP: affonso_list_affiliates(status: PENDING)
    Affonso MCP->>Database: Query affiliates
    Database->>Affonso MCP: Return data
    Affonso MCP->>AI Assistant: Formatted response
    AI Assistant->>User: "You have 3 pending affiliates..."
```

1. **You ask** your AI assistant a question about your affiliates
2. **The AI** calls the appropriate Affonso MCP tool
3. **Affonso** authenticates and executes the request
4. **Results** are returned in a readable format

## MCP Endpoint

```
https://api.affonso.io/mcp
```

The MCP server uses **Streamable HTTP** transport, which is supported by Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible clients.

## Authentication

MCP uses the same API keys as the REST API. You'll need a valid API key with appropriate permissions:

- **Production**: `sk_live_` + 32 characters
- **Development**: `sk_dev_` + 32 characters

<Warning>
Your API key has full access to your affiliate data. Never share it publicly or commit it to version control.
</Warning>

## Response Formats

All MCP tools support two response formats:

| Format | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Markdown** (default) | Human-readable output with formatting |
| **JSON** | Programmatic processing and detailed data |

Specify the format using the `responseFormat` parameter on any tool.
