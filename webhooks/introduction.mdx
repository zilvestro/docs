## What are Webhooks?

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time HTTP notifications when events occur in your Affonso affiliate program. Instead of polling our API for changes, webhooks push data to your server the moment something happens.

## How Webhooks Work

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Affonso
    participant Your Server
    
    Affonso->>Your Server: POST /your-webhook-endpoint
    Note over Your Server: Process event data
    Your Server->>Affonso: 200 OK
```

1. **Event occurs** - An affiliate signs up, a referral converts, a commission is paid, etc.
2. **Affonso sends a POST request** - We send a JSON payload to your configured endpoint
3. **Your server processes the event** - Handle the data as needed
4. **Respond with 200 OK** - Confirm receipt of the webhook

## Security

All webhook requests include a signature header for verification:

```
X-Affonso-Signature: sha256=...
```

We sign each payload using HMAC-SHA256 with your webhook secret. Always verify this signature before processing webhook data.

## Retry Policy

If your endpoint doesn't respond with a `2xx` status code, we'll retry the webhook with exponential backoff:

| Attempt | Delay |
|---------|-------|
| 1 | Immediate |
| 2 | 1 minute |
| 3 | 5 minutes |
| 4 | 30 minutes |
| 5 | 2 hours |

After 5 failed attempts, the webhook delivery is marked as failed.

## Payload Structure

All webhook payloads follow a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_abc123",
  "type": "referral.converted",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific data
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique event identifier |
| `type` | The event type (e.g., `affiliate.created`) |
| `createdAt` | ISO 8601 timestamp of when the event occurred |
| `data` | Event-specific payload data |
