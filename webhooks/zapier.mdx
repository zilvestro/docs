4. Click **Continue** once the test is successful

### Step 5: Set Up Your Action

## Working with Webhook Data

### Accessing Payload Fields

Zapier automatically parses the JSON payload. You can access fields using dot notation:

| Zapier Field | Example Value |
|-------------|---------------|
| `data.affiliateId` | `aff_abc123` |
| `data.email` | `john@example.com` |
| `data.commissionAmount` | `50.00` |
| `data.status` | `READY_FOR_PAYMENT` |
| `timestamp` | `2024-01-15T10:30:00Z` |

### Filtering Events

Use Zapier's **Filter** step to only continue when certain conditions are met:

```
Filter: Only continue if...
└── data.commissionAmount > 100
└── data.status = "READY_FOR_PAYMENT"
```

### Formatting Data

Use **Formatter by Zapier** to transform data:

- Convert timestamps to readable dates
- Calculate percentages
- Format currency values
- Extract text from fields

## Multi-Step Zaps

Create powerful automations by chaining multiple actions:

```
Trigger: affiliate.created

Step 1: Slack → Send notification to #affiliates
Step 2: Google Sheets → Add row to "Affiliates" spreadsheet  
Step 3: Mailchimp → Add subscriber to "Affiliates" list
Step 4: Notion → Create page in "Affiliate Database"
```
