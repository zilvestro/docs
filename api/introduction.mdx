The `partnershipStatus` field indicates the relationship status between an affiliate and a program:

- **`APPROVED`** - Affiliate is active and can promote the program
- **`PENDING`** - Affiliate applied but hasn't been approved yet
- **`REJECTED`** - Affiliate application was rejected
- **`null`** - No partnership exists (affiliate hasn't completed onboarding)

**Note:** `partnershipStatus` can be `null` for affiliates who haven't completed their onboarding process yet. The status is only set after the affiliate applies to and gets approved/rejected for a specific program.
