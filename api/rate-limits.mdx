## Rate Limit Tiers

Rate limits are based on your Affonso subscription plan:

| Plan | Requests/Minute | Burst/Second |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| Launch | 300 | 10 |
| Growth | 600 | 20 |
| Elite | 1,200 | 40 |
| Enterprise | 3,000 | 100 |

## Response Headers

Every API response includes rate limit information in the headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests allowed per minute |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining in current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when limit resets |
| `Retry-After` | Seconds to wait (only on 429 responses) |

## Handling Rate Limits

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
    "message": "Too many requests. Please retry after 30 seconds.",
    "retryAfter": 30
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Implement exponential backoff">
    When you receive a 429, wait for the `Retry-After` duration, then retry with exponential backoff.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cache responses">
    Cache API responses where appropriate to reduce the number of requests.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use pagination">
    Use pagination with reasonable page sizes instead of fetching all records at once.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Batch operations">
    Where possible, batch multiple operations into fewer API calls.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example: Handling Rate Limits

```javascript
async function fetchWithRetry(url, options, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    const response = await fetch(url, options);
    
    if (response.status === 429) {
      const retryAfter = response.headers.get('Retry-After') || 30;
      console.log(`Rate limited. Retrying in ${retryAfter}s...`);
      await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, retryAfter * 1000));
      continue;
    }
    
    return response;
  }
  throw new Error('Max retries exceeded');
}
```
