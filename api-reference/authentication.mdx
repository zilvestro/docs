## API Keys

All API requests require authentication using an API key. You can generate API keys from your [Affonso Dashboard](https://affonso.io/app/affiliate-program/connect/api).

<Warning>
  API keys are only shown once when created. Make sure to copy and store your key securely.
</Warning>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.affonso.io/v1/affiliates" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_api_key_here"
```

## Key Formats

| Prefix | Environment | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `sk_live_` | Production | Use for live data |
| `sk_dev_` | Development | Use for testing (coming soon) |

## Permissions

API keys can have different permission levels:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `read:affiliates` | View affiliate data |
| `write:affiliates` | Create and update affiliates |
| `read:referrals` | View referral data |
| `write:referrals` | Create and update referrals |
| `create:clicks` | Track click events |
| `read:commissions` | View commission data |
| `write:commissions` | Create and update commissions |
| `read:payouts` | View payout data |
| `write:payouts` | Update payout status |

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Never expose keys in client-side code">
    API keys should only be used in server-side code. Never include them in JavaScript that runs in the browser.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use environment variables">
    Store your API keys in environment variables, not in your codebase.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rotate keys regularly">
    Regenerate your API keys periodically and after any potential security incident.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use minimal permissions">
    Only grant the permissions your integration actually needs.
